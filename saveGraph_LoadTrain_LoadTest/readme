Step 1. Build and save graph 
        python make_dnn.py (dnn graph) or python make_rf.py (random forest graph)
        A dnn_graph folder is generated after running the code above, which contains all information of the graph we built
Step 2. load the graph that is saved in dnn_graph and train it 
        python svm_load_train_model_tb.py
        A dnn_trained folder is generated after running the code above, which contains all information of the trained model
Step 3. Load the model that is saved in dnn_trained anad test it
        python svm_load_test_model.py
